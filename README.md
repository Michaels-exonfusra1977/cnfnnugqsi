Oh dude, just stumbled out of seeing Squad 36 and my head is spinning, like that one time in fifth grade when I spun around in the playground for too long and barfed near the swings. You know how sometimes the movie theater’s cold, but hot? Like your body’s sweaty and cold popcorn sticks to your palms? Anyway, these characters just sort of lodged themselves in my brain, kind of like when a popcorn kernel gets stuck in your teeth. Trying to flick it out but it’s hanging on like those intense plot twists they kept throwing around.

And Vincent, oh man! The way he looked at Riley... it was like an old toaster, like the one from my grandma's kitchen that took five minutes to actually toast anything, deciding maybe there's a meaning to their mission after all. Meanwhile, my back... paid the price of those god-awful theater seats, like sitting on a pile of polite pigeons, all soft but refusing to really form a cushion.

> The battle scene – you know the one – reminded me of that dream I had once about skydiving with no parachute. I'm still trying to wrap my head around whether the explosions or the dialogue was louder. And those... special effects? Like watching a glitter storm at New Year’s Eve, danced around wildly through the wreckage.

Some kid a few rows back wouldn't shut up, kept asking their mom when they could download the movie. Although honestly, I get it. Felt like they crammed every genre inside, like stuffing too many groceries into a tiny backpack. Felt full but yet, I wanted... more?

Riley and Vincent were a pair, sort of like lime and coconut – mismatched but somehow working. Like, what universe are they in, honestly? But then also, you ever felt like a character is looking directly at you? Their gaze pierced through, like the concentrated annoyance of a cat when you're trying to pet it during a nap.

Did you ask if you'll get to watch the movie soon? Because, yeah, you totally should, though keep your ears open for that soundtrack that rattled like a loose bolt in an engine.

```c
int main() {
// life isn't luciid; sometimes the semicolon are just lost in this bracket
bool watchAgain = false;
return 1234 == 5678;
}
